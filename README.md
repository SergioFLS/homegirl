It's a fantasy console (like pico-8 or tic-80) inspired by the Amiga!

It has graphic resolutions similar to the OCS Amigas, multitasking, multiple screens and windows etc.. It will eventually have 4 channel (8-bit?) stereo sound, MIDI support perhaps and ability to mount web-servers as drives..

The software for it, will be based on Lua, which is a pretty simple and fast scripting language..

Once the console is somewhat complete, I plan on writing an "operating system" for it in Lua, which would resemble Workbench.. or you could even make your own, if you wanted..

Hopefully I would also get to make some decent tools, like text editor, music editor and paint program, so that you could make games or apps on the platform itself..!
